# Volume-Volatility-Slicing

This repository presents a novel approach to tackling the challenges of large-volume trading, specifically addressing market impact and slippage caused by substantial order execution. Our proposed strategy leverages Exponential Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to dynamically predict future trading volumes and price ranges. These predictions enable traders to segment order sizes adaptively, optimizing execution efficiency while minimizing market impact.

Key highlights of this strategy include:
<br>
1. Dynamic Order Slicing: Adapts execution sizes based on real-time volatility and volume estimations. <br>
2. Improved Execution Efficiency: Reduces slippage and enhances trading outcomes in volatile market conditions. <br>
3. Scalable & Practical: Offers a robust foundation for developing advanced adaptive execution algorithms.
